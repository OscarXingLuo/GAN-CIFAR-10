Create a GAN for the CIFAR-10 dataset.

1. Read data and reformat in appropriate size ####
	- Download data
	- Visualize the images

2. Build a simple tensorflow network ####
	- One input layer, one convolutional (with strides), one fully connected output layer. 

3. Build the discriminator ####
	- Make a simple working discriminator first.

4. Build the generator ####
	- Make a simple generator first.

5. Combine both of them ####
	- Make it so both can run together.
6. Make the discriminator more complex. ####
7. Make the generator more complex. ####
8. Done. ####

File setup:
- The models, discriminator and generator in one file.
- Read data in one file.
- Datasets in subfolder.
